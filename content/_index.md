# 💻⌨️
I strive to optimize my workflow by predominantly utilizing keyboard shortcuts over the mouse, a method I find to be significantly more efficient.

On my machine, I use [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland), [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty), [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/).
